# To-Do List App

The **To-Do List App** is a web-based task management application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to create, edit, complete, and delete tasks, making it easy to organize daily activities and manage time efficiently. Users can also optionally assign a date and time to each task, which is displayed alongside the task in a readable format.

## Features
- Add new tasks with optional date and time.
- Mark tasks as completed with a single click.
- Edit task names dynamically.
- Delete tasks when they are no longer needed.
- Responsive and user-friendly interface with visually appealing styles.
- Tasks are displayed in a clean list with clear buttons for actions.

## How It Works
- Users submit tasks through a form with a text input and optional datetime input.
- Tasks are dynamically added to an unordered list (`ul`) as list items (`li`), with buttons for completing, editing, or deleting the task.
- Clicking the complete button toggles a strike-through style to indicate the task is done.
- The edit button allows users to modify task text via a prompt.
- The delete button removes the task from the list immediately.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a task name and optionally select a date and time.
3. Click **Add Task** to save it to the list.
4. Use the ‚úÖ button to mark a task as completed, ‚úè to edit, and üóë to delete it.
